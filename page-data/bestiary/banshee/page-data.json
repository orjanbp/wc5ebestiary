She knows the general direction they're in but not their exact locations.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Incorporeal Movement.</em></strong> The banshee can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. She takes 5 (1d10) force damage if she ends her turn inside an object.</p>\n<h3>Actions</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The banshee makes three attacks: one with its Banshee's Curse and two with its withering touch.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Withering Touch.</em></strong> <em>Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/60 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 12 (2d8 + 3) necrotic damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Banshee's Curse.</em></strong> One creature of the banshee's choice within 60 feet of it must make a Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on all ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls until the end of the banshee's next turn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Wail (Recharge 4-6).</em></strong> The banshee releases a mournful wail. This wail has no effect on constructs and undead. All other creatures within 30 feet of her that can hear her must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d12) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Possession (1/Day).</em></strong> One humanoid that the banshee can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the banshee; the banshee then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The banshee now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The banshee can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.\n<br/>    The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the banshee ends it as a bonus action, or the banshee is turned or forced out by an effect like the <em>dispel evil and good</em> spell. When the possession ends, the banshee reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Anti-magic Shell.</em></strong> The banshee adds 3 to its AC against one spell attack that would hit it. To do so, the banshee must see the attacker.</p>\n<p><br/> <br/></p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"path":"/bestiary/banshee","title":"Banshee","type":"undead"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
