Until the grapple ends, the creature is restrained, and the naga cannot constrict another target.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Crashing Wave (Recharges 5-6).</em></strong> The naga charges forward creating a wave of water that crashes anyone on its path. The naga moves 20 feet forward in a straight line producing a wave 20 feet long, 10 feet tall and 10 feet wide . Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (5d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).</em></strong> For 1 minute, the naga can utter a special command or warning whenever a non-hostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the naga. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the naga is incapacitated.</p>\n<h3>Reactions</h3>\n<p><strong><em>Parry.</em></strong> The naga adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the naga must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"path":"/bestiary/naga-war-lord","title":"Naga War Lord","type":"humanoid"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
