Hit:  12 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 5 (1d8) cold damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Horn.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Roar.</em></strong> The yeti emits a roar. Each creature within 30 feet of the yeti and able to hear the roar must make a DC15 Wisdom saving throw, being Frightened for 1 minute on a fail. A Frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the roar of all yetis for 1 day.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Deadly Leap.</em></strong> If the yeti jumps at least 20 ft. as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 18 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked prone and take 30 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6).</em></strong> The yeti exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (6d10) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>\n<p>The yeti can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The yeti regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Claw Attack.</em></strong> The yeti makes one claw attack.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Leap Attack (Cost 2 actions).</em></strong> The yeti makes a deadly leap attack.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"path":"/bestiary/abominable-yeti","title":"Abominable Yeti","type":"monstrosity"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
