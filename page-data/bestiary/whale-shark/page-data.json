If the whale shark dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 24 (3d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage.
