The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Create Spawn.</em></strong> The wraith targets a humanoid within 10 feet of it that died a violent death and has been dead for no longer than 1 minute. The target's spirit rises as a wraith spawn in an unoccupied space by the corpse, under the wraith's control. The wraith spawn has the same statistics as the wraith, except that it has an Intelligence and Charisma score of 1, it cannot speak or use Create Spawn, and its Life Drain does not reduce a target creature's hit point maximum. The wraith can have no more than two wraith spawns active under its control at one time.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"path":"/bestiary/wraith","title":"Wraith","type":"undead"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
