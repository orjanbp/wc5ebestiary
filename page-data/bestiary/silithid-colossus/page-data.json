If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the silithid can't bite another target.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) slashing damage.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Swallow.</em></strong> The silithid makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the silithid, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the silithid's turns.\n<br>    If the silithid takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the silithid must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the silithid. If the silithid dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"path":"/bestiary/silithid-colossus","title":"Silithid Colossus","type":"beast"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
