## What's under the hood?

The project uses [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) as its JS framework, built from reusable components and served as a static website. Other packages include:

- [Font Awesome](https://www.npmjs.com/package/font-awesome)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [Remark](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/)
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
- [Typefaces](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typefaces)

The project uses the following folder structure:

    .
    /parser
    /src
      /applications
          /components
          /data
          /utils
          /views
      /components
      /css
      /images
      /markdown-pages
      /pages
      /stores
      /templates

1. **`/parser`**: This directory contains a Node app for transpiling the data in the original project books to markdown pages that can be used in this project.

2. **`/applications`**: Each app project that is part of this toolkit sits in its own folder in this directory.

   1. **`/components`**: Reusable components that are unique for an application are contained here.

   2. **`/data`**: Static Graphql queries for data that is used by the component is stored here. Static arrays and objects, retrieved as getters, can also be stored here.

   4. **`/utils`**: This directory contains functions important to the app, that are self-contained enough to extract to their own files. Separate from components, as they export functions -- not JSX elements.

   5. **`/views`**: This directory contains all components inside an application that are composed views, rather than reusable components. Two different views of the same Bestiary app page, for example.

3. **`/components`**: This directory contains all components that can be reused across the whole website.

4. **`/css`**: This directory contains all static boilerplate CSS files.

5. **`/images`**: This directory contains all static images.

6. **`/markdown-pages`**: This directory contains all static markdown pages, that are converted to Gatsby pages via remark.

7. **`/pages`**: This directory contains all app pages, that aren't built from a markdown page. Each app will have its own page here, rendering the views of that app.

3. **`/stores`**: Data stores are kept globally and used per-context in different apps. Contexts are provided to the app globally through `gatsby-browser.js` and `gatsby-ssr.js`.

8. **`/templates`**: This directory contains all templates used to convert markdown pages.
