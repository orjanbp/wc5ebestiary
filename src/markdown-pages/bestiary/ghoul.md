> ***Multiattack.*** The ghoul makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.
>
> ***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage.
>
> ***Cannibalize (Recharge after a Short or Long Rest).*** The ghoul cannibalizes the corpse of a humanoid that has been dead for less than a day, regaining 10 hit points. Each creature of the ghoul's choice that is within 30 feet of the ghoul and can see it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's save is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to any ghoul's cannibalize for the next 24 hours.
