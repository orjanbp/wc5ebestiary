> ### Actions
> ***Intertwine.*** The wisp enters the space of another creature and attempts entwine it in place. The target must pass a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end of the target's turns, it can make another save, ending the paralysis on a successful one. While the wisp has a creature intertwined, attack rolls against it has disadvantage. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this wisp's intertwine for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Renew (Recharge 5-6).*** One plant that the wisp can see within 5 feet of it is renewed by the wisp; the wisp disappears. The wisp can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect while renewing a plant. The renewed plant regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the plant takes fire damage, the renew doesn't function at the start of its next turn. The plant dies if it starts its turn with 0 hit points.
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The renew lasts until the renewed plant drops to 0 hit points, the wisp ends it as a bonus action. When the plant takes damage, the wisp must pass a Concen&shy;tration saving throw (as if concentrating on a spell) or be pushed out of the plant.
