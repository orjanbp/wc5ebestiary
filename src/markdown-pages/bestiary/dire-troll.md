> ***Berserk.*** Whenever the troll starts its turn with 60 hit points or fewer, it must make a DC 11 Wisdom save. On a failed save, the troll goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the troll attacks the nearest crea&shy;ture it can see. If no creature is near enough to move and attack, the troll attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the troll goes berserk, it continues to dos so until its killed or regains all its hit points.
>
> ***Regeneration.*** The troll regains 15 hit points at the start of its turn. If the troll takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the troll's next turn. The troll dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The troll makes two fist attacks. It then uses its toss if able.
>
> ***Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained.
>
> ***Toss.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, range 60/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (1d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. The troll can't use this attack if it doesn't have a target grappled. Both the target thrown and hit takes damage from the attack.
>
> ***Rock*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, range 50/100 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (7d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
