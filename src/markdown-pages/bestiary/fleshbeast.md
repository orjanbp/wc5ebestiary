> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The fleshbeast makes two attacks: one with its tentacle and one with its bite.
>
> ***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller creature. *Hit:* The creature must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, or have the fleshbeast lash onto it. When done, the fleshbeast is considered grappled and shares the same space as the creature and it gains advantage on its bite attack. In addition, at the start of each of the target's turns, the target takes 7 (2d6) acid damage.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitu&shy;tion saving throw against disease or become poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 3 (1d6) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured. A swarm of insect's crawl out of a creature 1d4 rounds after it died if it was diseased upon its death.
