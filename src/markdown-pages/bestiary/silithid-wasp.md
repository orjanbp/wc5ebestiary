> ***Keen Hearing and Sight.*** The silithid has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or sight.
>
> ***Hive Mind.*** The silithid can transmit simple messages and emotions to any silithid within 240 feet of it that is part of the same hive.
>
> ***Flyby.*** The silithid doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The silithid makes two sting attacks.
>
> ***Sting.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage.
>
> ***Noxious Spit.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) poison damage, and the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While poisoned this way, any non-silithid creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
