> ***Hold Breath.*** The tar creeper can hold its breath for 30 minutes.
>
> ***Tar Stench.*** Any creature other than a tar creeper that starts its turn within 5 feet of the tar creeper must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the stench of all tar creepers for 1 hour.
>
> ***Swamp Camouflage.*** The tar creeper has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in swampy terrain.
>
> ***Swamp Mobility.*** The tar creeper ignores difficult terrain created by swamps, and can see through non magical mists of swamplands.
>
> ***Charge.*** If the tar creeper moves at least 10 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, the target takes an additional 14 (3d8) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The tar creeper makes two attacks with its poison claws.
>
> ***Poison Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.
>
> ***Tar Spray (1/Day).*** The tar creeper sprays sticky tar in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw a creature's speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions.
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A creature can remove the tar on itself during a short or long rest by bathing in water, alcohol, or vinegar.
