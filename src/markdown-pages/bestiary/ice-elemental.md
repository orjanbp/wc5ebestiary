> ***Frost Form.*** The elemental can burrow through non magical unworked ice and snow. While doing so, the elemental doesn't disturb the material it moves through. A creature that touches the elemental or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10) cold damage. Additionally, the elemental freezes non-creature liquids within a 10-foot radius of it. A creature caught in the liquid when the elemental freezes it is grappled (escape DC 14).
>
> ***Ice Walk.*** The elemental can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost extra movement.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The elemental makes two attacks.

> ***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
