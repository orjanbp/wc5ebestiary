> ***Kick.*** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2 + 4) slashing damage.
>
> ***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the trogg can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 ft. of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the trogg. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the trogg is incapacitated.
