> ### Actions
> ***Siphon Life.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 18 (4d8) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The spectre regains hit points by an amount equal to half the necrotic damage dealt.
>
> ***Horrifying Wail.*** Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the spectre that can hear it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success.
