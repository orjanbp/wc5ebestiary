>
> ***Hive Mind.*** The silithid can transmit simple messages and emotions to any silithid within 240 feet of it that is part of the same hive.
>
> ***Charge.*** If the silithid moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with its claws on the same turn, the target takes an extra 16 (3d10) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
>
> ***Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If the silithid takes 14 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The silithid makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the silithid can't bite another target.
>
> ***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d10 + 5) slashing damage.
>
> ***Swallow.*** The silithid makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the silithid, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the silithid's turns.
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the silithid takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the silithid must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the silithid. If the silithid dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.
