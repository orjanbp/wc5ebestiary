> ***Keen Smell.*** The lion has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
>
> ***Pack Tactics.*** The lion has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the lion's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
>
> ***Pounce.*** If the lion moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the lion can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.
>
> ***Running Leap.*** With a 10-foot running start, the lion can jump up to 25 feet.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The lion makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.
>
> ***Terrifying Roar.*** Each creature within 30 ft. of the lion that can hear it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the lion's Terrifying Roar for the next 24 hours.
