> ***Ethereal Sight.*** The ghost can see 60 ft. into the Spirit World when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.
>
> ***Incorporeal Movement.*** The ghost can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The ghost makes two melee attacks.
>
> ***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.
>
> ***Heavy Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d10) piercing damage.
>
> ***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the ghost can utter a special command or warning whenever a non-hostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the ghost. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the knight is incapacitated.
>
> ***Etherealness.*** The ghost enters the Spirit World from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Spirit World, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Parry.*** The ghost adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
