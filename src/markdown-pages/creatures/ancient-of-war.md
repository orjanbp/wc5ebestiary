> ***False Appearance.*** While the ancient remains motion&shy;less, it is indistinguishable from a normal tree.
>
> ***Resilient Nature.*** Unless the ancient of war is incapa&shy;citated, it and plant creatures of its choice within 60 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.
>
> ***Siege Monster.*** The ancient deals double damage to objects and structures.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The ancient makes two slam attacks.
>
> ***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Rock.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, range 60/180 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (5d8 + 6) bludgeoning.
>
> ***Take Root.*** The ancient buries its roots in the ground or uproots them. While rooted, the ancients speed becomes 0, it gains advantage on its attack rolls, and is immune to any effect that would force the ancient to move or be moved.
>
> ***Animate Trees (1/Day).*** The ancient magically animates five or fewer trees that it can see within 60 feet of it. The trees have the statistics of a treant, except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1 and they only have the Claw action. An animated tree acts as an ally of the ancient. The tree remains animated for 1 day, until it dies, or until the ancient takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. If the tree doesn't die and is made inanimate, it takes root again if it can.
