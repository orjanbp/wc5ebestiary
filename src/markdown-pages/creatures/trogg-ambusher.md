>
> ***Stench.*** Any creature other than a trogg that starts its turn within 5 feet of the trogg must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the stench of all troggs for 1 hour.
