>
> ***Poisonous Kiss.*** If the harpy kisses a humanoid on the lips, the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1d4 hours. While poisoned in this way, the target also has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws.
>

>

>
> ***Talons.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 2 (1d4) poison damage.
>
> ***Incapacitating Screech (Recharge 6).*** The harpy emits a horrific screech. Each creature within 15 feet of it that can hear it and that isn't a harpy must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be incapaci&shy;tated until the end of the harpy's next turn.
