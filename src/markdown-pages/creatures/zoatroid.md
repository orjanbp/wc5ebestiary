> ***Hold Breath.*** While out of water, the zoatroid can hold its breath for 1 hour.
>
> ***Water Breathing.*** The zoatroid can breathe only underwater.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Tentacles.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage, plus 13 (3d8) psychic damage. If the target is a crea&shy;ture, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until the grapple ends, the zoatroid shares space with it, the target is blinded, and the zoatroid can't use its tentacles on another target without ending the grapple.
>
> ***Enslave (Recharge 6).*** One humanoid grappled by the zoatroid must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be enslaved by the zoatroid; the enslaved target goes on the zoatroids initiative, it controls the target's body using its actions, but it doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The enslave deprives the target of its vision but not its awareness. The zoatroid can be targeted by attacks, spells, and other effects, but any attack roll that misses it automatically hits its enslaved target.
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enslavement lasts until the target drops to 0 hit points, the zoatroid ends it as a bonus action, or a creature uses their action to attempt a grapple check contested by the zoatroid.
>
> ***Fogged Mind (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** Each non-aberration creature within 10 feet of the zoatroid must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Reactive Shield.*** The zoatroid forces an attack roll that would hit it to instead hit its enslaved target. To do so, the zoatroid must be able to see the attacker.
