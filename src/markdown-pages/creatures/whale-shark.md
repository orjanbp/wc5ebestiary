> ***Blood Frenzy.*** The whale shark has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hit points.
>
> ***Water Breathing.*** The whale shark can breathe only underwater.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The whale shark makes three bite attacks. It can make one tail attack in place of one bite attack.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (3d12 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature affected by the whale shark's Inhale, that creature is swallowed. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the whale shark, and it takes 28 (8d6) acid damage at the start of each of the whale shark's turns.
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the whale shark takes 40 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the whale shark must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the whale shark. If the whale shark dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.
>
> ***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (3d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from the whale shark and knocked prone.
>
> ***Inhale.*** The whale shark inhales water in a 15-foot cube in front of it. Each creature in that cube that is Large or smaller must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or have their movement speed reduced to 0 until the end of the whale shark's next turn.
