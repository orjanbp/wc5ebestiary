> ***Keen Hearing and Sight.*** The silithid has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or sight.
>
> ***Hive Mind.*** The silithid can transmit simple messages and emotions to any silithid within 240 feet of it that is part of the same hive.
>
> ***Spider Climb.*** The silithid can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
>
> ***Standing Leap.*** The silithid’s long jump is up to 30 ft. and its high jump is up to 15 ft., with or without a running start.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The silithid makes two bite attacks.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.
>
> ***Deadly Leap.*** If the silithid jumps at least 15 ft. as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 14 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target’s choice) or be knocked prone and take 17 (4d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (4d6 + 3) slashing damage.
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn’t knocked prone, and is pushed 5 ft. out of the silithid's space into an unoccupied space of the creature’s choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls prone in the silithid's space.
