>
> ***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, the ogre can move up to its speed toward an enemy of its choice that it can see or hear. It must end this move closer to the enemy than it started.
>
> ***Mighty Presence.*** While it is conscious, the ogre and any friendly creature within 10 feet of it has advantage on saving throws against being frightened.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The ogre makes two greatclub attacks, one of which can be replaced with its shockwave.
>
> ***Greatclub.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Rock.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, range 60/180 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (4d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Shockwave (Recharge 5-6).***  The ogre hits the ground with its greatclub causing a burst of concussive force. Each creature in a 15-foot cone  originating from the ogre must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain.
