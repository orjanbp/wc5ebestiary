> ***Incorporeal Movement.*** The wraith can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
>
> ***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the wraith has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Life Drain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 21 (4d8 + 3) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
>
> ***Create Spawn.*** The wraith targets a humanoid within 10 feet of it that died a violent death and has been dead for no longer than 1 minute. The target's spirit rises as a wraith spawn in an unoccupied space by the corpse, under the wraith's control. The wraith spawn has the same statistics as the wraith, except that it has an Intelligence and Charisma score of 1, it cannot speak or use Create Spawn, and its Life Drain does not reduce a target creature's hit point maximum. The wraith can have no more than two wraith spawns active under its control at one time.
