> ***Frightful Screech.*** Each creature within 60 feet of the serpent that can hear it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this serpent's Frightful Screech for the next 24 hours.
