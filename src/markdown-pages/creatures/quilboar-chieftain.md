> ***Tusk.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.
>
> ***Battleaxe.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage, or 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.
>
> ***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the quilboar can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its rolls provided it can hear and understand the quilboar. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the quilboar is incapacitated.
