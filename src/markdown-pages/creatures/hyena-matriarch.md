> ***Pack Tactics.*** The hyena has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the hyena's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
>
> ***Rampage.*** When the hyena reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, the hyena can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.

> ***Leadership.*** Once per turn, the hyena can let out a cry when a friendly hyena that it can see within 10 feet of it makes an attack roll. The hyena can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear the cry. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time.
