>
> ***Thrower Weapon (Recharge 5-6).*** The tank uses its thrower to spew out a blast of destructive energy. The mechano-tank type determines the size, shape, and damage type of the thrower's attack. Each creature in the area of the thrower must make a DC 14 saving throw, the type of which is determined by the tank's thrower type. A creature takes 18 (4d8) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
>
> ***Charged Leap (Recharge 6).*** The tank leaps high into the air, landing in a space no more than 60 feet from where it started. Each creature in the tank's space when it lands must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) damage of the tank's thrower type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed saving throw, a target is knocked prone.
