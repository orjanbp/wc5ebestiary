> ***Multiattack.*** The elemental makes two attacks: one with its slam and one with its gust.
>
> ***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Gust.*** One target must make a DC 11 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 7 (2d6) bludgeo&shy;ning damage and is flung up to 20 feet directly away from the elemental and knocked prone. If the saving throw is successful, the target only takes half damage and isn't flung away or knocked prone.
>
> ***Upheaval (Recharge 4-6).*** The elemental pushes dust upwards at a point it can see within 15 feet of it. Each creature other than the elemental within 5 feet of the upheaval must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of the elemental's next turn. The elemental needs loose earth, rock, or something similar to use upheaval.
