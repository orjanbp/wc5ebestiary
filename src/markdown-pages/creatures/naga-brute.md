> ***Amphibious.*** The naga can breathe air and water.

> ***Slippery.*** The naga has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The naga makes one bite attack and one slam attack.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (3d8 + 5) piercing damage.
>
> ***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (4d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Massive Crash (Recharges 4-6).*** The naga slams the ground creating an earth tremor around it. Each creature other than the naga in a 10-foot radius centered on the naga must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 31 (7d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.
