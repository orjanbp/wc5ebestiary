> ***Death Burst.*** When the wyrm dies, it explodes in a burst of arcane. Each creature within 15 feet of it must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
>
> ***Magic Sense.*** The wyrm can sense magic users within 30 feet of it, and focus its attacks on those creatures.
>
> ***Mana Burn.*** Whenever the wyrm hits a target with its bite, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or have their lowest available spell slot expended. The target regains any spell slots lost in this way when they finish a short rest.
