> ### Actions
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 2 (1d4) piercing damage, and the larva attaches to the target. While attached, the larva doesn't attack. Instead, at the start of each of the larva's turns, the target loses 2 (1d4) hit points due to blood loss.
> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The larva can detach itself by spending 5 feet of movement. It does so after it drains 10 hit points of blood from the target or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the larva.
