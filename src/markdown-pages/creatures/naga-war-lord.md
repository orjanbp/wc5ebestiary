>
> ***Amphibious.*** The naga can breathe air and water.
>
> ***Slippery.*** The naga has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The naga makes two halberd attacks, one of which can be replaced with its constrict attack.
>
> ***Halberd.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 20 (3d10 + 4) slashing damage.
>
> ***Constrict.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller creature. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the creature is restrained, and the naga cannot constrict another target.
>
> ***Crashing Wave (Recharges 5-6).*** The naga charges forward creating a wave of water that crashes anyone on its path. The naga moves 20 feet forward in a straight line producing a wave 20 feet long, 10 feet tall and 10 feet wide . Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (5d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.
>
> ***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the naga can utter a special command or warning whenever a non-hostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the naga. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the naga is incapacitated.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Parry.*** The naga adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the naga must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
